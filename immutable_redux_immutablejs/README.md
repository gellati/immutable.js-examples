# Redux-thunk for a click counter

The project exemplifies the use of [`immutable.js`](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) in a click counter.

Install the dependencies:

    npm i

Usage:

    npm run start

Now open a browser in `http://localhost:8080/`.

Originally based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt4P9BKOPfI), but using [immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) instead of plain javascript.
