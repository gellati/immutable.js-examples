# Redux-thunk for a click counter using immer

The project exemplifies the use of [`immer`](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) in a click counter.

Install the dependencies:

    npm i

Usage:

    npm run start

Now open a browser in `http://localhost:8080/`.

Originally based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt4P9BKOPfI), but using [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) instead of plain javascript. This [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFuRvcAEiHg) is also worth a watch.
