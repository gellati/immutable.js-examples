# Examples of immutable.js and use in Redux

Immutability is a concept in programming whereby data in use is never modified. If changes need to be made, the data is copied and the changes are applied on the copy. This makes it easier to track changes made to the data.

This repo showcases some example usages of [immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) and then how it can be used in [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
